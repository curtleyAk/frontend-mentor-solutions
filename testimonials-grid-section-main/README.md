## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- CSS Grid

### What I learned

Just a bit more on positioning, it was pretty easy (granted i do remember this on travesy media, so I kinda cheated knowing this project before). I liked using pseudo selectors, makes things easy without creating too many unnecessary classes. 

To see how you can add code snippets, see below:

```css
.card:nth-child(1) .card__img {
    border: 2px solid hsl(264, 82%, 80%);
}
.card:nth-child(2) .card__img {
    border: 2px solid hsl(0, 0%, 81%);
}
.card:nth-child(4) .card__img {
    border: 2px solid hsl(263, 55%, 52%);
}
```

### Continued development

I want to continue learning about CSS alignment like flexbox, grid and float in order to better display sections in my websites.

### Useful resources

- [Example resource 1](https://css-tricks.com/snippets/css/complete-guide-grid/) - A guide to CSS grid, focusing on all the settings both for the grid parent container and the grid child elements.
