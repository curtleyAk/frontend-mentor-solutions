## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- Grid

### What I learned

I was able to do a lot better with positioning thit time. I learnt a lot about how to target particular elements using ::marker. I also did some light scanning through aespect-ratios's, I want know a bit more about those. I also started using margin-block-end instead of margin-bottom, still wrapping my head around the concept to see if there's any differance. Also border-collapse, this is to merge two elements' borders to make it more cleaner and uniform.
I liked using span in HTML to target text in order to apply a style, it's not a foreign concept, but haven't used it in a while.

To see how you can add code snippets, see below:

```css
.pricing {
    display: grid;
    grid-template-columns: 1fr 1fr;
    margin-block-end: 1.5rem;
    align-items: center;
    justify-content: center;
    gap: 1rem;
}
```

### Continued development

I want to continue learning about CSS alignment like flexbox, grid and float in order to better display sections in my websites.

### Useful resources

- [Example resource 1](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/::marker) - The ::marker CSS pseudo-element selects the marker box of a list item, which typically contains a bullet or number.
